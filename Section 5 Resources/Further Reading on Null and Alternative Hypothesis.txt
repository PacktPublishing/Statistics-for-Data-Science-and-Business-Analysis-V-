Following a discussion in the Q&A, we have decided to include further clarifications regarding the previous lecture (Null vs Alternative).


First, we'd like to note that, conventionally, we always include the equality sign in the null hypothesis.



Student question: 

As per the above logic, in the video tutorial of the salary of the data scientist, the null hypothesis should have been: Data Scientists do not make an average of $113,000. Also in the second example, the null Hypothesis should have been: The average salary should be less than or equal to $125,000. 

Please explain further. Also please share some further documentation/reference material.

Now note that the statement is above is NOT true. This confusion motivated us to clarify further. 

Instructor's answer (with some adjustments as 2-3 answers were combined):

'I see why you would ask this question, as I asked the same one right after I was introduced to hypothesis testing.

In statistics, the null hypothesis is the statement we are trying to reject. Think of it as the 'status-quo'. The alternative, therefore, is the change or innovation. 

Example 1: So, for the data scientist salary example, the null would be:  the mean data scientist salary is $113,000. Then we will try to reject the null with a statistical test. So, usually, your personal opinion (e.g. data scientists don't earn exactly that much) is the alternative hypothesis.

Example 2: Our friend Paul told us that the mean salary is >=$125,000 (status-quo, null). Our opinion is that he may be wrong, so we are testing that. Therefore, the alternative is: the mean data scientist salary is lower than $125,000.

It surely is counter-intuitive in the beginning, but later on, when you start doing the exercises, you will understand the mechanics. '

We hope that clears some doubts you may have had. Please complete the quiz after this lecture, to reinforce what you've learned :)
